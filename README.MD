This is an implemintation of https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19660007973, specifically, equation 11.
<H2>So, what does this do?</h2>
Given a the position of the moon at time of impact (from Horizons https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/), and the inclination of the orbit that will be launched into, there exists a time (ususally two times a day) that launching into this incination, and extending your orbit into a highly eliptical orbit that coincides at apogee to the orbit of the moon, will lead to you and the moon being in the same position.
<h2>Wait, What?</h2>
This lets you hit the moon, given a desired inclination, by telling you when to launch.
<h2>How do you use this</h2>
